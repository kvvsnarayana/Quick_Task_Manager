# Quick_Task_Manager
I used a Python List to store task strings because it allows for efficient ordered storage and indexing.

A command-line interface (CLI) application built with Python to help users manage daily tasks efficiently.

# 🚀 Features
* CRUD Operations: Create, Read, and Delete tasks.
* Persistent Storage: Tasks are automatically saved to a `tasks.txt` file, ensuring data is not lost when the program closes.
* Input Validation: Handles user choices to prevent crashes from invalid inputs.

# 🛠️ Technical Implementation
* Language: Python 3.x
* Core Concepts: Lists: Used for efficient in-memory task management.
* File I/O: Implemented `with open()` for safe and automated file handling.
* Control Flow: Utilized `while` loops and conditional logic for a seamless user experience.

# 📦 How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone [Your-Repo-URL]`
3. Run the script: `python task_manager.py`
